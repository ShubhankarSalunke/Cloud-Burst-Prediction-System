# Cloudburst Prediction System

## Overview
The Cloudburst Prediction System is a web application built using Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of cloudbursts based on weather conditions. It utilizes machine learning models trained on relevant environmental data. The application also includes a landslide prediction feature.

## Features
- **Cloudburst Prediction**: Users can select a state and city to fetch current weather data and input additional parameters for prediction.
- **Landslide Prediction**: Users can enter geological and environmental factors to assess landslide risk.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive Streamlit interface with dropdowns, input fields, and prediction results.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Pandas
- Requests
- Joblib
